                <h2>Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of AI that enables computers to learn from data and improve their
                    performance without being explicitly programmed. It identifies patterns and makes predictions by
                    analyzing large datasets. There are three main types: supervised learning, which learns from labeled
                    data; unsupervised learning, which finds patterns in unlabeled data; and reinforcement learning,
                    where models improve through trial and error.

                        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is making a huge
                        difference in both education and healthcare
                        in ways we never imagined. In schools, AI
                        is helping students learn in a way that fits
                        them best, with tools like virtual tutors and smart
                        grading systems making things more efficient. On the
                        healthcare side, AI is giving doctors a hand by
                        detecting diseases earlier, like spotting signs
                        of breast cancer, and managing patient care better.
                        Both fields are seeing how AI can take on tasks,
                        speed things up, and ultimately make life easier
                        for everyone. Pretty cool, right?</h2>
