                    <h2>Computer Vision is the ability of a computer to interpret and understand the visual world. It's
                        about enabling machines to see and process images or videos in a way that's similar to how
                        humans
                        do. By using AI algorithms, computer vision can identify objects, faces, or even entire scenes
                        from visual data. This technology is being used in various applications, from self-driving cars
                        to facial recognition systems, and is helping to make our lives easier and more efficient.

                    Computer vision is changing
                    the game in security by making
                    surveillance, facial recognition,
                    and threat detection way more advanced.
                    AI-powered cameras can spot suspicious
                    activity and unauthorized access in real
                    time, helping law enforcement and
                    security teams respond faster. Itâ€™s
                    also used in biometric authentication
                    to make access control in workplaces
                    and public spaces more secure.

                    In the automotive world, computer vision
                    is a must-have for self-driving cars. It
                    helps with lane detection, reading traffi
                    signs, and avoiding obstacles. Even in
                    regular cars, features like automatic
                    parking and collision avoidance rely on
                    it to make driving safer and smoother.
                    Whether it's keeping people safe or
                    making cars smarter, computer vision
                    is making a big impact.
